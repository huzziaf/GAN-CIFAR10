# CIFAR-10 Image Generation with DCGAN

This repository contains the implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and analysis of generated images.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. For this implementation, the dataset is divided into 80% training and 20% testing subsets.

## Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Normalize the CIFAR-10 dataset before feeding it into the network.

### 2. DCGAN Model Training

- Construct and train the DCGAN model on the training subset.
- Use class labels for the real images and "Fake" for the generated images, resulting in CIFAR-10 classes + 1 "Fake" class.

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning

- Fine-tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and optimizer type to improve model performance.

### 4. Image Generation and Visualization

- Visualize five randomly selected images generated by the DCGAN model.
- Compare these generated images with five real images from the test subset.
- Discuss the visual quality and characteristics of the generated images, including color fidelity, object clarity, and any recurring artifacts.

### 5. Loss Curves and Analysis

- Plot the loss curves for both the generator and discriminator over each training epoch.
- Analyze the convergence behavior of these curves, commenting on any observed trends or anomalies.
